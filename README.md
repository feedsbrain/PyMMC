PyMMC: Python Mobile Media Converter
===

- Requirements
- Python 2.6
- FFmpeg (compiled --with faac tag)
- libfaac
- libxvid
- This program is a simple program to demonstrate the ease of programming in the Python language. If you're just about to serious in Linux Rapid Application Development then I suggest you to use Python.

PyMMC inspired by same software made by MIKSOFT with RealBASIC. But it's only support conversion to 3gp format (at least for now :D). PyMMC's work as a simple GUI to FFmpeg.

I made this program at the same time I learn Python. I need at least two days to create this application :p So I guess I must warn you about the bugs that may rise. I know about the thread issue of application and I still need a better references to implement threading on Python.
